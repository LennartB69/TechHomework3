                <h2>Tech Research Task Into Deforestation</h2>

                <p>About</p>
                <p>This is a blog on deforestation. Some back story to this is needed as it says on the top this was a non voluntary research task as this was my homwwork that i did forget about and now writing at 9:12pm.</p>
                <p>This "blog" we will be talking about the great economic benifits of deforestation and some of the environmental impacts of deforestation such as undertanding FSC and how deforestation doesn't have to be viewed in a negative perspective as we all are linked to it in some way nearly every day.</p>
